<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>
    Knowing that most of the code generated today has been created before begs the question - what if developers didn&#39; need to remember it, search for it, and type it again?
</p>
<p>
    Learning from the past, focusing on the future, that&#39;s the bedrock Tabnine is built on. Our AI-powered code completion tool embodies that vision by harnessing the collective achievements of every qualified piece of open source code ever written and serving that knowledge to our users in the form of code completion suggestions. As we move forward, Tabnine&#39;s AI will play a valuable role in shaping the entire software development lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Tabnine&#39;s AI studies mountains of publicly available open source code and combines that with knowledge of your specific project and preferences creating code suggestions customized just for you. That saves you tons of keystrokes, and tons of time, all while keeping you aligned with best practices, and avoiding frustrating typos.
</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>
    Got a question? We&#39;ve got the answer - Check out our <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/faq">FAQ page</a>
</p>
<h3>Tabnine Support</h3>
<p>
    Having some trouble with installation? Something not working the way you hoped? <strong>Tabnine Support</strong> is always happy to help. Feel free to contact us anytime at <a href="mailto:support@tabnine.com">support@tabnine.com</a>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>
    Your privacy is paramount, that&#39;s why Tabnine uses a dual model design. While the public GPT-2 model works its magic continuously scanning hundreds of millions of trusted open source parameters, a second separate model runs locally on your machine keeping your code 100% private. 
</p>
<p>
    Find out more about how we keep your code private <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/code-privacy">here</a>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the local model focuses on learning your personal and project coding preferences, constantly improving the quality and accuracy of your code suggestions. Always separate. Always secure. Always private.
</p>
<h3>Tabnine Hub</h3>
<p>
    A quick click on <strong>Tabnine</strong> on your IDE status bar takes you directly to your <strong>Tabnine Hub</strong> where you can easily update and manage all your account options and customize your suggestion preferences.
</p>
<h3 id="-usage-"><strong>Usage</strong></h3>
<p>
    After Tabnine’s installation, navigate to the Tabnine&#39;s plugin section (go to -> file -> settings -> plugins) and verify that Tabnine local model is successfully loaded.
</p>
<p>
    Tabnine is a textual autocomplete extension. When you type a specific string in your editor, you will view Tabnine completion dialog, with Tabnine suggestions according to the text you type
</p>
<h3 id="-deep-completion-"><strong>Deep Completion</strong></h3>
<p>
    Deep Tabnine is trained on millions of files from GitHub. During training, Tabnine’s code completion goal is to predict the next token given the tokens that came before. To achieve this goal, Tabnine learns complex behavior, such as type inference in dynamically typed languages
</p>
<p>
    Deep Tabnine can use subtle clues that are difficult for traditional tools to access. For example,
    the return type of <code>app.get_user()</code> is assumed to be an object with setter methods, while the return type of <code>app.get_users()</code> is assumed to be a list
</p>
<p>
    Deep Tabnine is based on GPT-2, which uses the Transformers Network Architecture. This architecture was first developed to solve problems in natural language processing. Although modeling code and modeling natural language might appear to be unrelated tasks, modeling code requires understanding English in some unexpected ways</li>
